it is a java library for monitoring Aurora Inverter PVI series. It's part of Web Application I built to monitor my own Aurora Inverter PVI-2000 which uploads data to pvoutput.org.
The library is provided with Test Set useful to understand its behavior.
It allows sending command in MODBUS format through a serial communication and handles responses.
